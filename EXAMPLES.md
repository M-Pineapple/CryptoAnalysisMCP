## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
- Specify the cryptocurrency symbol
- Mention the timeframe you're interested in
- State your risk tolerance if asking for signals

### 2. Use Context
- Mention if you're day trading, swing trading, or investing
- Provide your current position if relevant
- Ask about specific price levels you're watching

### 3. Ask Follow-up Questions
- "What if price breaks below that support level?"
- "How does this compare to last week's analysis?"
- "What are the key levels to watch for a breakout?"

### 4. Combine Analyses
- Ask for multiple timeframes
- Request both patterns and indicators
- Get both technical and risk analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No data available"** - The cryptocurrency symbol might not be supported
2. **"Insufficient data"** - Not enough historical data for the requested timeframe
3. **"Rate limit exceeded"** - Too many requests; wait a moment and try again

### Supported Symbols
Make sure to use standard symbols like:
- BTC (Bitcoin)
- ETH (Ethereum)  
- ADA (Cardano)
- SOL (Solana)
- DOT (Polkadot)
- LINK (Chainlink)
- MATIC (Polygon)
- AVAX (Avalanche)

### Best Practices
- Wait a few seconds between requests
- Use clear, specific cryptocurrency names
- Specify your timeframe preference
- Ask for clarification if results are unclear
