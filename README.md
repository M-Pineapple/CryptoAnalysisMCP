## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a paid API key to use this MCP?

**Short answer**: Depends on your trading style.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Day traders and scalpers NEED a Pro subscription ($99/mo). The free tier only provides daily candles, which is useless for intraday trading.

**What works WITHOUT any API key:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time price data (with slight delays)
- ‚úÖ Swing trading analysis (3-7 day trades)
- ‚úÖ Position trading (weeks to months)
- ‚úÖ Long-term investment analysis
- ‚úÖ All technical indicators on DAILY timeframe
- ‚úÖ 1 year of daily historical data
- üÜï Basic price data for 7+ MILLION tokens via DexPaprika
- üÜï Liquidity pool data across all major DEXes
- üÜï DEX price comparison and aggregation

**What REQUIRES a Pro API key ($99/mo):**
- ‚ùå Day trading (you need hourly/4h data)
- ‚ùå Scalping (you need minute data)
- ‚ùå Intraday patterns and signals
- ‚ùå Real-time/low-latency updates
- ‚ùå Historical data beyond 1 year
- ‚ùå Any timeframe shorter than daily

**How to get your FREE API key:**
1. Go to [CoinPaprika API](https://coinpaprika.com/api/)
2. Click "Start Free" 
3. Register for an account
4. Get your API key
5. Add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/path/to/crypto-analysis-mcp",
      "env": {
        "COINPAPRIKA_API_KEY": "your-free-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The free tier includes:
- ‚úÖ 25,000 API calls per month
- ‚úÖ 1 year of daily historical data
- ‚úÖ 2,500+ cryptocurrencies

**For advanced features**, upgrade to [CoinPaprika Pro](https://coinpaprika.com/api/):
- ‚ùå 4-hour and hourly timeframes (Pro required)
- ‚ùå Extended historical data beyond 1 year
- ‚ùå Higher rate limits
- ‚ùå Priority support

### Can I use CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko API instead?

**Currently**: Not directly - this MCP is specifically built for CoinPaprika's API structure.

**Coming in v1.2.0**: CoinMarketCap API support! üéâ

Key differences:
- **CoinMarketCap**: Different endpoint structure (support coming in v1.2.0!)
- **CoinGecko**: Different data format (planned for future release)
- **CoinPaprika**: Best coverage (71,000+ assets vs 10,000-20,000 for competitors)

We chose CoinPaprika first because:
- 3x more market coverage than competitors
- More generous free tier
- Better historical data access
- Superior API reliability (99.9% uptime)

Once v1.2.0 is released, you'll be able to switch between CoinPaprika and CoinMarketCap APIs with a simple configuration change!

### What cryptocurrencies are supported?

**üÜï v1.1: Now supports 7+ MILLION tokens!**

With our new DexPaprika integration:
- ‚úÖ **All 2,500+ CoinPaprika tokens** (major coins with full analysis)
- ‚úÖ **7+ MILLION DEX tokens** via DexPaprika (automatic fallback)
- ‚úÖ **Every token on every DEX** across 23+ blockchains
- ‚úÖ **Brand new tokens** - analyze tokens minutes after launch
- ‚úÖ **Obscure meme coins** - if it trades on a DEX, we have it
- ‚úÖ **NO API KEY NEEDED** for basic price data

Examples:
- Major coins: BTC, ETH, SOL (full technical analysis via CoinPaprika)
- Popular memes: DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, WOJAK (price data from any source)
- New launches: That token that launched 5 minutes ago on Uniswap
- Any ERC-20, BEP-20, SPL token, or token on any supported chain

Just use the ticker symbol - the MCP automatically finds it!

### Why am I getting 402 Payment Required errors?

You're trying to use features that require a Pro subscription:

**Common causes:**
- Using any timeframe other than 'daily' (4h, 1h, 15m, etc.)
- Requesting data older than 1 year
- Exceeding rate limits (rare)

**Solutions:**
1. **For swing trading/investing**: Just use 'daily' timeframe - it's free!
2. **For day trading**: You MUST [upgrade to CoinPaprika Pro](https://coinpaprika.com/api/) ($99/mo)

**There is NO free option for day trading**. If you need intraday data, you need to pay.

### How accurate are the trading signals?

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Trading signals are for informational purposes only!

- Based on well-established technical indicators
- No prediction is 100% accurate
- Always do your own research
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
- Consider multiple factors beyond technical analysis

### Can I use this for automated trading?

While technically possible, we **strongly advise caution**:
- This MCP provides analysis, not execution
- Requires additional safety mechanisms
- Needs proper risk management
- Should be thoroughly backtested
- Consider paper trading first

### How often does the data update?

Depends on your API tier:
- **Free tier**: ~1-5 minute delays
- **Pro tier**: 30-second updates for prices
- **Cached locally**: 1-5 minutes to reduce API calls

### Is my API key secure?

Yes! Your API key:
- Is never hardcoded
- Only read from environment variables
- Never logged or transmitted
- Only used for CoinPaprika API calls
- Follows security best practices

### Can I contribute to this project?

Absolutely! We welcome contributions:
- Bug fixes
- New indicators
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Feature suggestions

See our [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines.

2. Check that the binary has execute permissions: `chmod +x crypto-analysis-mcp`
3. Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes

### API Rate Limits

The free tier of CoinPaprika has rate limits. If you encounter 402 errors, consider:
- Using daily timeframe (most compatible with free tier)
- Adding an API key for higher limits
- Implementing request throttling

### Build Issues

If you encounter build errors:
1. Ensure Swift 5.5+ is installed: `swift --version`
2. Clean the build: `swift package clean`
3. Update dependencies: `swift package update`
