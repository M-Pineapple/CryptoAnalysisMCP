- Xcode 13+ (for development)
- Claude Desktop

## Installation

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/CryptoAnalysisMCP.git
cd CryptoAnalysisMCP
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
./build-release.sh
```

3. Configure Claude Desktop by adding to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/path/to/CryptoAnalysisMCP/crypto-analysis-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

### Global Installation (Optional)

```bash
sudo cp ./.build/release/CryptoAnalysisMCP /usr/local/bin/crypto-analysis-mcp
```

Then use this in Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/crypto-analysis-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can use these commands in Claude:

### Get Current Price
```
crypto-analysis:get_crypto_price
  symbol: "BTC"
```

### Technical Indicators
```
crypto-analysis:get_technical_indicators
  symbol: "ETH"
  timeframe: "daily"
```

### Chart Pattern Detection
```
crypto-analysis:detect_chart_patterns
  symbol: "SOL"
  timeframe: "4h"
```

### Trading Signals
```
crypto-analysis:get_trading_signals
  symbol: "ADA"
  risk_level: "moderate"
  timeframe: "daily"
```

### Full Analysis
```
crypto-analysis:get_full_analysis
  symbol: "DOT"
  timeframe: "weekly"
  risk_level: "aggressive"
```

### Support & Resistance
```
crypto-analysis:get_support_resistance
  symbol: "MATIC"
  timeframe: "daily"
```

### Multi-timeframe Analysis
```
crypto-analysis:multi_timeframe_analysis
  symbol: "AVAX"
```

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

The MCP now supports **ALL cryptocurrencies** available on CoinPaprika through dynamic symbol resolution. Just use the ticker symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, etc.).

Common symbols are cached for performance, while any other symbol is dynamically resolved via the API.

## Configuration

### API Key (Optional)

For higher rate limits and access to premium features, you can add a CoinPaprika API key:

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
export COINPAPRIKA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

2. Or add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/path/to/crypto-analysis-mcp",
      "env": {
        "COINPAPRIKA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Timeframes

- `4h` - 4-hour candles
- `daily` - Daily candles (default)
- `weekly` - Weekly candles
- `monthly` - Monthly candles

## Risk Levels

- `conservative` - Lower risk, focus on strong signals
- `moderate` - Balanced approach (default)
- `aggressive` - Higher risk, more sensitive signals

## Troubleshooting

### MCP not appearing in Claude

1. Ensure the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is absolute
2. Check that the binary has execute permissions: `chmod +x crypto-analysis-mcp`
3. Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes

### API Rate Limits

The free tier of CoinPaprika has rate limits. If you encounter 402 errors, consider:
- Using daily timeframe (most compatible with free tier)
- Adding an API key for higher limits
- Implementing request throttling

### Build Issues

If you encounter build errors:
1. Ensure Swift 5.5+ is installed: `swift --version`
2. Clean the build: `swift package clean`
3. Update dependencies: `swift package update`
