## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need a paid API key to use this MCP?

**Short answer**: For basic daily timeframe analysis, no. For full functionality, yes.

The free CoinPaprika API tier includes:
- ‚úÖ Real-time price data
- ‚úÖ 1 year of daily historical data
- ‚úÖ 25,000 API calls per month

**However**, many advanced features require a [CoinPaprika Pro subscription](https://coinpaprika.com/api/):
- ‚ùå 4-hour and hourly timeframes
- ‚ùå Extended historical data (beyond 1 year)
- ‚ùå Higher rate limits
- ‚ùå Priority support

For the best experience, we recommend getting a CoinPaprika Pro API key starting at $99/month.

### Can I use CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko API instead?

**Currently**: Not directly - this MCP is specifically built for CoinPaprika's API structure.

**Coming in v1.1.0**: CoinMarketCap API support! üéâ

Key differences:
- **CoinMarketCap**: Different endpoint structure (support coming in v1.1.0!)
- **CoinGecko**: Different data format (planned for future release)
- **CoinPaprika**: Best coverage (71,000+ assets vs 10,000-20,000 for competitors)

We chose CoinPaprika first because:
- 3x more market coverage than competitors
- More generous free tier
- Better historical data access
- Superior API reliability (99.9% uptime)

Once v1.1.0 is released, you'll be able to switch between CoinPaprika and CoinMarketCap APIs with a simple configuration change!

### What cryptocurrencies are supported?

All 2,500+ cryptocurrencies available on CoinPaprika! This includes:
- Major coins (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
- Meme coins (DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, etc.)
- DeFi tokens (UNI, AAVE, etc.)
- Layer 2 tokens (ARB, OP, MATIC, etc.)
- Any new listings on CoinPaprika

Just use the ticker symbol - the MCP handles the rest!

### Why am I getting 402 Payment Required errors?

This means you're trying to access paid features with a free API key:
- Using 4h or hourly timeframes (free tier only supports daily)
- Requesting data older than 1 year
- Exceeding rate limits

**Solution**: Either use daily timeframe or [upgrade to CoinPaprika Pro](https://coinpaprika.com/api/).

### How accurate are the trading signals?

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Trading signals are for informational purposes only!

- Based on well-established technical indicators
- No prediction is 100% accurate
- Always do your own research
- Never invest more than you can afford to lose
- Consider multiple factors beyond technical analysis

### Can I use this for automated trading?

While technically possible, we **strongly advise caution**:
- This MCP provides analysis, not execution
- Requires additional safety mechanisms
- Needs proper risk management
- Should be thoroughly backtested
- Consider paper trading first

### How often does the data update?

Depends on your API tier:
- **Free tier**: ~1-5 minute delays
- **Pro tier**: 30-second updates for prices
- **Cached locally**: 1-5 minutes to reduce API calls

### Is my API key secure?

Yes! Your API key:
- Is never hardcoded
- Only read from environment variables
- Never logged or transmitted
- Only used for CoinPaprika API calls
- Follows security best practices

### Can I contribute to this project?

Absolutely! We welcome contributions:
- Bug fixes
- New indicators
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates
- Feature suggestions

See our [Contributing](#contributing) section for guidelines.

- Xcode 13+ (for development)
- Claude Desktop

## Installation

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Pineapple/CryptoAnalysisMCP.git
cd CryptoAnalysisMCP
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
./build-release.sh
```

3. Configure Claude Desktop by adding to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/path/to/CryptoAnalysisMCP/crypto-analysis-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

### Global Installation (Optional)

```bash
sudo cp ./.build/release/CryptoAnalysisMCP /usr/local/bin/crypto-analysis-mcp
```

Then use this in Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/crypto-analysis-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once configured, you can use these commands in Claude:

### Get Current Price
```
crypto-analysis:get_crypto_price
  symbol: "BTC"
```

### Technical Indicators
```
crypto-analysis:get_technical_indicators
  symbol: "ETH"
  timeframe: "daily"
```

### Chart Pattern Detection
```
crypto-analysis:detect_chart_patterns

```

## Supported Cryptocurrencies

The MCP now supports **ALL cryptocurrencies** available on CoinPaprika through dynamic symbol resolution. Just use the ticker symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH, DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, etc.).

Common symbols are cached for performance, while any other symbol is dynamically resolved via the API.

## Configuration

### API Key (Optional)

For higher rate limits and access to premium features, you can add a CoinPaprika API key:

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
export COINPAPRIKA_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

2. Or add to Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crypto-analysis": {
      "command": "/path/to/crypto-analysis-mcp",
      "env": {
        "COINPAPRIKA_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Timeframes
